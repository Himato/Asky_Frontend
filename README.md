# Asky
Asky is a question-and-answer topic-oriented website (e.g. Quora, Reddit). Asky's goal is to communicate and develop awareness around the world. There are currently only a few available a vast amount of knowledge that would be valuable to many people â€” either locked in people's heads, or accessible to select groups only. We want to connect people with knowledge to the people who need it, bring people with different perspectives together so that they can better understand each other, and empower everyone to share their knowledge for the benefit of the rest of the world.
