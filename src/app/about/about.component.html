      <h3>Our Goal</h3>
      <p>
        Asky's goal is to communicate and develop awareness around the world.
        There are currently only a few available a vast amount of knowledge
        that would be valuable to many people — either locked in people's heads, or accessible to select groups only.
        We want to connect people with knowledge to the people who need it, 
        bring people with different perspectives together so that they can better understand each other, 
        and empower everyone to share their knowledge for the benefit of the rest of the world.

      <h3>Who I am ?</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Ibrahim Gamal, and I’m a Software Developer raised in Egypt.
        I started programming since my childhood but I didn't concentrate on a specific technology.
        I started in web then desktop moving to mobile. And, I actually never settled down on one.
        And, I love programming, building things, and problem solving.

        I love to build awesome stuff, this is one of the things why I love coding because it gives
        me the ability to build. One of the things that makes me love coding also is problem solving.

      <h3>My Story</h3>
      <p>
        I started learning when I was 14, I wanted
        to create a website for my Facebook page and I has no idea what programming is, actually I didn’t
        know that there’s something called programming. So, I started googling on how to build a website and one
        thing let to another and I found myself learning how to create a blog using Blogger. And when I created my
        first blog, I want to edit a lot of things in the template and make my website even better, so I started
        learning how to edit these templates using HTML and CSS. And till then I had no idea what the programming
        is. Till I encountered with a Visual Basic course, I watched it with passion and I always wanted more. And
        when my 6 years older brother saw me building desktop apps, he introduced me to computer science and
        told me that I can work in this area and become a developer. So, he made me even more passionate for
        learning, and when I grow up, I went to the college to major in Computer Science.
